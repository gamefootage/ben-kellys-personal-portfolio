# Ben Kelly's Personal Portfolio
## Overview
My project is a portfolio for myself, Ben Kelly, that essentially displays the information found on my [CV](./assets\docs\ben-kelly-cv-sept-2020.pdf) in a creative way through the means of this webpage.  
It tells the user all about me, my background, my interests, and my work and work history. It portrays an accurate and positive view of me and my life.
## User Experience
The purpose of this sight is to show potential employers my relevant skills, qualities and information that would help them decide to hire me for whatever job they might be offering.
For employers from the tech industry, they also get a taste of what I can do by using and viewing the website itself. This website acts as both a virtual CV and example of the work I can do, killing two birds with one stone. The site incorporates a one page scrolling design to recreate the form a document, like my CV, might take. The advantages of the website allow an interactive experience, such as the use of hover on capable devices and buttons.
> ### User Stories

## Features
### Existing Features
- The site incorporates what is known as parallax scrolling. This is where elements are scrolling at different speeds to create a 3D effect.
- The navigation bar is fixed at the top of the page, on screens smaller than 1200px it becomes a collapsible and has a burger icon to toggle it.
- The "About" section uses 3 images at different points on the Z axis that, when hovered on, reveal paragraphs relevant to the photo of me.
- The skill section has 4 buttons for different areas of skill I have (basketball, Gaelic football, rugby, and technology). When these buttons are pressed they display the information relevant to the subject, pressing ones deacivates the others.
- The work experience timeline shows all the jobs I've had and the period I worked them, when hovered on they reveal more information about the subsequent job.
- Lastly the fixed footer at the bottom has links to my [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ben.kelly.7509), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-kelly-a36b001b2/), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/benkelly___/), [GitHub](https://github.com/gamefootage), a ["mailto" link](mailto:benskelly10@gmail.com), a [WhatsApp link](https://wa.me/353852030033), and a [Google map link](https://goo.gl/maps/LJCFoNLXqws8qawE8) of Galway, Ireland.

## Technologies Used
- [**Bootstrap 4.0**](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/)  
  - Bootstrap CSS allows for ease in responsive sizing and compononents such as nav bars and collapsible elements.
  - Using Bootstrap JS allowed me to make the skill section buttons show and hide information and make the nav bar expandable on small devices.
- [**Font Awesome**](https://fontawesome.com/)
    - Using Font Awesomes provided link tag I could use their icons on the buttons in the skill section and for my footer links.

- [**Keith Clark's Pure CSS Parallax Article**](https://keithclark.co.uk/articles/pure-css-parallax-websites/)
    - Through Keith's article I obtained a method of creating a parallax scrolling effect with pure css, rather than the usual JavaScript methods.
- [**Stack Overflow**](https://stackoverflow.com/)
    - Many of the questions I had during the creation of this site had already been asked and answered on stack overflow, I found it a great tool to solve many problems I had.
- [**Google Fonts**](https://fonts.google.com/)
    - Google Fonts is a vast library of fonts that I used to test and pair the fonts I ended up using in this project.
